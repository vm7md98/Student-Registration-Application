# Student-Registration-Application
Advanced OO Programming (2022)

In this project I used NetBeans as an IDE to create a Student Registeration Application by using Java Language. This is a high-level of OOP since I used MVC and [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) such as [Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method), [State](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state), [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) and [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade).
